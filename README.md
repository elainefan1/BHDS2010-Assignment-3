# BHDS2010-Assignment-3
Project Details: Creating a stratified box plot of text messages by Group and Time, creating a stratified bar chart of text messages by Group and Time, creating summary statistics, and learning how to use github collobratively. 

10/29 Elaine created initial code for Visualization #1, Files have been added to the github.
Josh created Visualization #2 code and has been added to the github.
Josh created summary Statistics and they have been added.
Elaine created this readME and compiled all the code into one .Rmd for submission.

The dataset given has 4 variables; group, baseline, six_months, and participant. We should  look at Group, and the two time points, baseline and six months. I changed the table into a long format to use Time and the text message count as variables, and created a stratified boxplot based on group. Josh also similarly changed the format into a long format, and used Time and text message count as variables for his stratified box plot. He outputted summary statistics, showing mean, standard deviation, number of entries, variance in messages, minimum of messages, maximum of messages, IQR, and median of messages.
